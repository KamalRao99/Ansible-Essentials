
Ansible Lab Steps
=================
Login to AWS Console

################################################
Lab 1: Installation and Configuration of Ansible
################################################

# Launch an RHEL 9 machine in us-east-1. Choose t2.micro. In security group, 
# allow SSH (22) and HTTP (80) for all incoming traffic. Add Tag Name: Ansible-ControlNode

# Once the EC2 is up & running, SSH into it and set the hostname as 'Control-Node'. 
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname Control-Node
# Now you can exit and login again. It will show the new hostname.
# or you can type 'bash' and open another shell which shows new hostname.

# Update the package repository with latest available versions
sudo yum check-update

# Install latest version of Python. 
sudo yum install python3-pip -y 
python3 --version


# Install awscli, boto, boto3 and ansible
# Boto/Boto3 are AWS SDK which will be needed while accessing AWS APIs
sudo pip3 install awscli boto boto3 ansible==4.10.0
pip show ansible

# Now configure aws cli to provide the credentials of the IAM user.
aws configure
Enter AKID (Access Key)
Enter SAK (Secret Key)


# If you need to create new credentials, Follow below steps
Go to aws console. On top right corner, click on your name or aws profile id. 
when the menu opens, click on Security Credentials
Under AWS IAM Credntials, click on Create access key. If you already have 2 active keys, 
you can deactivate and delete the older one so that you can create a new key

# Do the below smoke test to check if the configuration has worked. For the below commanbd, you should
# get a list of your s3 buckets. If you don't have any buckets the command won't output anything.
# You are ok, as long as it does not give any error.
aws s3 ls

# Install wget so that we can download playbooks from the training material repository 
sudo yum install wget -y

# download the playbook for creating 2 EC2 nodes as managed hosts for ansible setup
wget https://hpe-devops-training.s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-playbook.yml

ansible-playbook ec2-playbook.yml

# Once you get the ip addresses, do the following:
sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts

# Add the prive IP addresses, by pressing "INSERT" 
< Add Managed Node 1 Private IP >
< Add Managed Node 2 Private IP >
172.31.80.253
172.31.90.114

# Save the file using "ESCAPE + :wq!"

# list all managed node ip addresses.
ansible all --list-hosts

# SSH into each of them and set the hostnames.
ssh ec2-user@< Replace Node 1 IP >
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname managed-node-1
exit

ssh ec2-user@< Replace Node 2 IP >
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname managed-node-2
exit

# Use ping module to check if the managed nodes are able to interpret the ansible modules
ansible all -m ping



################################
Lab 2: Exploring Ad-Hoc Commands
################################

sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts

# Add the given line, by pressing "INSERT" 
# add localhost and add the connection as local so that it wont try to use ssh
localhost ansible_connection=local
# save the file using "ESCAPE + :wq!"

# In real life situations, one of the managed node may be used as the ansible control node.
# In such cases, we can make it a managed node, by adding localhost in hosts inventory file.


# get memory details of the hosts using the below ad-hoc command
ansible all -m command -a "free -h"
OR
ansible all -a "free -h"

# Create a user ansible-new in the 2 nodes + the control node
# This creates the new user and the home directory /home/ansible-new
ansible all -m user -a "name=ansible-new" --become

# lists all users in the machine. Check if ansible-new is present in the managed nodes / localhost
ansible <node ip> -a "cat /etc/passwd"

# List all directories in /home. Ensure that directory 'ansible-new' is present in /home. 
ansible <node ip> -a "ls /home"


# Change the permission mode from '700' to '755' for the new home directory created for ansible-new
ansible < Replace Node 1 IP > -m file -a "dest=/home/ansible-new mode=755" --become
Ex: ansible 172.31.22.228  -m file -a "dest=/home/ansible-new/ mode=755" --become

# Check if the permissions got changed
ansible 172.31.22.228 -a "sudo ls -l /home"


# Create a new file in the new dir in node 1
ansible <Node 1 IP> -m file -a "dest=/home/ansible-new/demo.txt mode=600 state=touch" --become
Ex: ansible 172.31.24.133 -m file -a "dest=/home/ansible-new/demo.txt mode=600 state=touch" --become

# Check if the permissions got changed
ansible 172.31.31.133 -a "sudo ls -l /home/ansible-new/"


# Add content into the file
ansible <Node 1 IP> -b -m lineinfile -a 'dest=/home/ansible-new/demo.txt line="This server is managed by Ansible"'
Ex: ansible 172.31.24.133 -b -m lineinfile -a 'dest=/home/ansible-new/demo.txt line="This server is managed by Ansible"'


# check if the lines are added in demo.txt
ansible 172.31.40.80  -a "sudo cat /home/ansible-new/demo.txt"


# You can remove the line using parameter state=absent
ansible 172.31.24.133 -b -m lineinfile -a 'dest=/home/ansible-new/demo.txt line="This server is managed by Ansible" state=absent'

# check if the lines are removed from demo.txt
ansible 172.31.31.133 -b -a "sudo cat /home/ansible-new/demo.txt"

# Now copy a file from ansible-control node to host node 1
touch test.txt
echo "This file will be copied to managed node using copy module" >> test.txt

ansible <Node 1 IP> -m copy -a "src=test.txt dest=/home/ansible-new/test" -b
Ex: ansible 172.31.24.133 -m copy -a "src=test.txt dest=/home/ansible-new/test" -b
# --become can be replaced by -b

# check if the file got copied to managed node.
ansible 172.31.31.133 -b -a "sudo ls -l /home/ansible-new/test"

Task 1: Playbook to install apache web server
=============================================
vi install-apache-pb.yml

# Add the given content, by pressing "INSERT"
---
- name: This play will install apache web servers on all the hosts
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Task1 will install httpd using yum
      yum:
        name: httpd
        #local cache of the package information available from the repositories configured on the system
        update_cache: yes
        state: latest
    - name: Task2 will upload custom index.html into all hosts
      copy:
        src: /home/ec2-user/labss/index.html
        dest: /var/www/html
    - name: Task3 will setup attributes for file
      file:
        path: /var/www/html/index.html
        owner: apache
        group: apache
        mode:  0644
    - name: Task4 will start the httpd
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started

- name:play 2 starts
# save the file using "ESCAPE + :wq!"

# State as 'Present' and 'Installed' are used interchangeably. They both do the same thing i.e. It 
# will ensure that a desired package is installed. Whereas State as 'Latest' means in addition
# to installation, it will go ahead and update if it is not of the latest available version.

# Now lets create an index.html file to be used as the landing page for the web server.
# In task2 of the above playbook, this 'index.html' will be copied to the document root of the 
# httpd server.

vi index.html

# Add the given content, by pressing "INSERT" 

<html>
  <body>
  <h1>Welcome to Ansible Training from CloudThat</h1>
  <img src= "https://d3ffutjd2e35ce.cloudfront.net/assets/logo1.png" >
  </body>
</html>

# save the file using "ESCAPE + :wq!"

# Now run the playbook so that it installs httpd to all the hosts and index.html is copied from 
# the ansible-control
ansible-playbook install-apache-pb.yml

curl <private_ip of node1> 
curl <private_ip of node2>

Task 2: Working with Handlers and Notify

#Create a playbook and the following contents:
$ vi notify.yml

---
- name: Manage httpd web service
  hosts: all
  become: true

  tasks:
    
    - name: Configure web service
      template:
        src: web_service_config.j2
        dest: /etc/config.conf
      notify: Restart Web Service

    - name: Start web service
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
        enabled: yes

  handlers:
    - name: Restart Web Service
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: restarted

#The notify keyword is used to trigger the handler named "Restart Web Service" if there are changes made during the configuration step. The handlers section defines the handler itself, named "Restart Web Service." It uses the service module to restart the web service.
#When the playbook runs, if there are changes made to the web service configuration during the template task, the handler will be triggered, and the web service will be restarted.

#Create your configuration template file as follows and the below contents to it
vi web_service_config.j2

# web_service configuration file

# Set the server port
port = 8080

# Set the maximum number of concurrent connections
max_connections = 100

# Set the log level
log_level = debug

#Execute the playbook.
ansible-playbook notify.yml

#When the playbook runs, the template module will copy this file to the destination /etc/web_service/config.conf on the web servers. If there are any changes made to this template file, the handler named "Restart Web Service" will be triggered, leading to the web service being restarted.


Task 3: Uninstall apache web server
===================================
# With slight modification, we can change the playbook to uninstall apache (self exercise)
cp install-apache-pb.yml uninstall-apache-pb.yml
vi uninstall-apache-pb.yml
# Retain only first task. Replace 'state: latest' with 'state: absent'

# Check if the playbook is ok
ansible-playbook uninstall-apache-pb.yml --check

# Now run the playbook and check in the browser if the web page exists.
ansible-playbook uninstall-apache-pb.yml

# Check the browser with the corresponding IPv4 DNS name and ensure webpage is removed.

Task 2: Using Dynamic Inventory 
#Create a python script and add the following contents:

$ vi dynamic.py 

#!/usr/bin/env python
import boto3
import json

# Initialize the AWS SDK
session = boto3.Session()

# Specify the AWS region
region = 'us-east-2'

# Create an EC2 client
ec2_client = session.client('ec2', region_name=region)

# Get the list of instances
response = ec2_client.describe_instances()

# Create an empty inventory dictionary
inventory = {'all': {'hosts': []}, '_meta': {'hostvars': {}}}

# Process the EC2 instances
for reservation in response['Reservations']:
    for instance in reservation['Instances']:
        # Get the instance details
        instance_id = instance['InstanceId']
        private_ip = instance['PrivateIpAddress']
        public_ip = instance['PublicIpAddress']

        # Add the instance to the inventory
        inventory['all']['hosts'].append(instance_id)

        # Add the host variables
        inventory['_meta']['hostvars'][instance_id] = {
            'ansible_host': public_ip if public_ip else private_ip
        }

# Output the inventory as JSON
print(json.dumps(inventory))

#Make the script executable: 
$ chmod +x dynamic.py 

#To list all the dynamic inventory hosts, you can run:
$ ansible-inventory -i dynamic.py --list

#In this example, we use a Python script to generate the dynamic inventory. The script utilizes the AWS SDK (boto3) to communicate with AWS and fetch the list of EC2 instances.
#The script retrieves the instance details such as Instance ID, Private IP, and Public IP. It then creates an inventory dictionary with 'all' and '_meta' groups.
#The 'all' group contains a 'hosts' list that includes all the instance IDs. The '_meta' group contains 'hostvars' where individual host variables are defined. In this case, we set the 'ansible_host' variable to the Public IP if available, otherwise the Private IP.

#In this playbook, we have two tasks. The first task runs a simple echo command on the delegate host (localhost 127.0.0.1) using the command module. We use the delegate_to parameter to specify the delegate host. The output of the command is captured in the result variable using the register keyword. The second task prints the stdout of the command using the debug module.
	

#Run the playbook
#To execute the playbook, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

ansible-playbook delegate.yml

#The task is being delegated to the localhost (127.0.0.1) that is the controller node.
#Once you use the delegate_to, by default, the facts gathered by any delegated tasks are assigned to the inventory_hostName (the current Host) instead of the host which produced the facts (the delegated tasks servers).

Lab 9: Implementing Jinja2 Templates
######################################################################################

#we will be implementing jinja2 template by writing a template for providing system information on startup.
#Create a new directory for templates 
$ mkdir templates
$ cd templates

#In that directory create a template file, let’s say template.j2

$ vi template.j2

#Put the below content into the newly created template file

Hello, {% if environment == 'prod' %}Production{% else %}Development{% endif %} environment!

Here are the servers:
{% for server in servers %}
- Name: {{ server.name }}
  IP: {{ server.ip }}
{% endfor %}
 
#In this example template, we use conditional statements (if and else) to check the value of the environment variable. Depending on its value, we display different greetings. We also iterate over a list of servers to display their names and IP addresses.

#Now create the playbook for implementing this jinja2 template that we created

$ vi implement-jinja2.yml

#Put the below content in the playbook:

---
- name: playbook
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: false
  vars:
    environment: "prod"
    servers:
      - name: Server 1
        ip: 172.31.13.48
      - name: Server 2
        ip: 172.31.15.4
  tasks:
    - name: Render template
      template:
        src: template.j2
        dest: /tmp/output.txt

 

#In this playbook, we have defined some variables (environment and servers) at the playbook level. These variables will be used for variable substitution in the Jinja2 template. We then use the template module to render the template.j2 file and save the rendered output to /tmp/output.txt.
#Now execute the playbook 

$ ansible-playbook implement-jinja2.yml

 

#SSH into one of the target hosts (webserver1 or webserver2) and check the contents of /tmp/output.txt:
#For that, do the following:

$ ssh ec2-user@< managed_node_ip >

$ cat /tmp/output.txt

#You should see the rendered output of the Jinja2 template, 
which includes the conditional greeting based on the environment variable and the list of servers with their names and IP addresses.
